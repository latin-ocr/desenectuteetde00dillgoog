77. 26. Ingrata . . . . debuit .· “ did not bear tho
injury inflicted on him by his ungrateful country
with the submission he ought.” Themistocles, for
the reasons assigned in the text, being sentenced to

tion among the Athenium, called ostraciam, entered
into the service of Artaxerxes, whose formidable
armaments against tbe Greeian states he had some
years before totally overthrown at the famous battle
of Salamis. Although Cicero positively asserts that
both Themistocles and Coriolanus destroyed them-
selves by their own hands, yet the disagreement
of historiens upon these points has lest the facts alto-
gether uncertain.

the signs of the timeS, I am not certain that this out-
rage (i. e. taking up anm against one'a country under

here to the partisans of Julius Caesar.
