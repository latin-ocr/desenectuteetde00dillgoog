tise “ De Divinatione‚” says that the eugurs were
accustomed to assemble at Rome on the Nones
for consultation. The Romans divided their months
into three parm, by KalendS, NoneS, and Ides. The
first day was Kalendae or Calendoe, (a calando vel
vocando‚) from the priest calling out to the people
that it was new moon; the fisth day, Nonae, the
Nones; the thirteenth, IduS, the Ides, from the obso-
lete, verb iduare, to divide, because the Ides nearly
divided the mouth. The Nones were so called be·-
cause, counting inclusively, they were nine days
from the Ides. In March, May, J uly, and October,
the Nones fell on the seventh and the Ides on the
fisteenth.
